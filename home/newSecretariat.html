      <a class="close" href="#">&times;</a>
      <div class="content">
        Having been a part of 12 MUN conferences and 1 parliamentary debate, Mantek has exhibited excellent administrative and leadership skills in the past and looks to build on that reputation with this MUN. His marvellous debating and speaking skills are what set him apart from the rest and along with the strong emphasis that he lays on innovative and new ideas, he considers himself to be the perfect mix of Harvey Specter and Steve Jobs. In his spare time you would see him in his room binge-watching on some tv series that he intends to force his friends to watch or coding and cribbing about how the question is not clear till his solution gets accepted.

        Her simplicity and her determination is what delineates her persona. She firmly holds the notion that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication and in character,in manner,in style the supreme excellence lies in being yourself.

Shivangi was a member of the IP team and live blogged the entire event last year .She has also been an active member of media teams of various  fests of the college.

She would  prefer spending time reading  books and  being lost in her own treasured world rather than hanging out or interacting with human beings.Her love for coffee ,music and books are the only things that describes her entire lifestyle.

      <div class="content">
        "Curiosity killed the cat but before that, it killed me." This is her life saying and so she sometimes ends up reading fiction by diving right into the climax first. Obsessing over books more than people, wrapping herself into the magical world of fantasy and T.V series yet being a hardcore realist, having a sarcastic veiwpoint alongwith a generously considerate persona, she's an oxymoron in herself. Not a lover of chocolates, you could think that she is hard to please, if only minions hadn't existed. If she could describe herself with absolute ease, I reckon there wouldn't be any surprises left to explore. Basically, she's everything we are and yet she's extraordinarily different.

      He is a self proclaimed connoisseur of dank memes, movies ,TV series and good music. He is fascinated by history and intrigued by philosophy. An ambivert realist by nature, he is capable of eating 3 medium sized pizza in a single sitting. He is the guy who you can talk to hours about nothing and everything, from life to lies which he claims to be the same which then tends to inspire and depress you, often at the same time. Mountains, beaches, city lights and tall buildings makes him sonder while all he wishes in life is to have a positive influence on humankind before fading away into oblivion. As the secretariat of socio-economic affairs he is dedicated to make sure that the voices of the delegates aren't left unheard.

        He’s usually lazing around making or browsing memes. When he’s not, however, he codes, he writes, and he can be found organising just about everything that goes on in this college. He’s fond of cyber security, reading, AI, politics and tech.Can play a total of 4 songs on the guitar.
He’s an editor at Nybles and founding member of AIESEC Allahabad. How he finds time to manage everything despite scouring online forums like Reddit and 4chan for the entire day is beyond understanding.
